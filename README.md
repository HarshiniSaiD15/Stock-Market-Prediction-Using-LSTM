Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM
This project implements a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock prices. It provides an interactive interface for intraday stock prediction, combining technical stock data and simulated sentiment logic for better decision-making.

Features
•	LSTM-based sequence modeling for stock prediction
•	Dual-layer architecture for enhanced learning
•	Real vs Predicted graph output
•	Simulated sentiment analysis
•	Streamlit web app for real-time interaction
•	CSV upload and date range support
